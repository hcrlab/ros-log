A ros-log polymer element used to display rosout info on the website. 

The ros-log element utilizes both ros-topic, and ros-websocket to subscribe to the rosout topic. The most important fields of the rosgraph_msgs are then displayed in a datatable using the paper-datatable element. The columns of this datatable can be ordered in ascending or descending order by clicking on the arrow next to the column's header.
